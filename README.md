Pong
====

A game of Pong written in Python.

It's pretty simple. I was trying out Pygame and different ideas about how to structure/code things in games. It's pretty old at this point and not really a great example of good coding style. 

The game allows the ball to go faster without limit and allows paddles to accelerate the ball. Those are about the only cool features.
